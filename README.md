# CpuInfo 

This repository contains the code of a small user-mode utility for identifying and determining CPU features.
More importantly this repository is dedicated to the extremely lightweight and portable PIF (Processor Information and Features) library, and various pieces from my private architecure specific library I call "baselib", shamelessly taken from the EDK2's internal library with the same name.
